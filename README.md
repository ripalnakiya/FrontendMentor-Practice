## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

It was a bit challenging task , but nonetheless I enjoyed making this interactive card and learnt a lot of things.
Especially the javascript part is tricky one , so I've added all the necessary comments in a layman's language to understsad.
I Hope my documentation helps you out!

### Useful resources

- [Selected Rating Animation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31178653/how-to-keep-active-css-style-after-click-a-button) - This might help if you are new to javascript and jQuery concepts , It took lot of experiments for me to learn why simple addClass() function for Selected Rating Animation wasn't working.
