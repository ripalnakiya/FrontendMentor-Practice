## My process

### Built with

- CSS flexbox

### What I learned

I hadn't practised the CSS flexbox , So it was a bit chllenging for me. With flexbox , it consumed very less time in aligning the items.

Have a look at the code snippet below:

```css
.container p:nth-child(2) {
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  margin: 2rem 1rem 1.5rem;
  color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

I have used a different type of CSS selector (nth-child) , which is very useful when you don't want to mess up your code by adding class attribute to every HTML tag.

### Useful resources

- [FlexBox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Nth-child Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-child.asp) - This really helped me in reducing the number of classed I would add to each paragraph tag.
- [Curved border](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) - This helped me in making the border of container and QR in curved shape . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
