## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

The only tricky part was to positon the image in the center.
More difficult part was to position both the background images , though it was fun learning it!

These lines sums up the complete code for background.

```css
  background: url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg) left -45vw top -57vw no-repeat,
    url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg) right -20vw bottom -45vw no-repeat,
    hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  background-size: 95vw, 70vw;
```


### Useful resources

- [Background CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - This will really help you in positioning the background curves in the page.
