## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Without Flexbox

### What I learned

This was very simple challenge and even more simpler when you use flexbox.

But the thing is I wanted to hone my css skills , and have practised css display properties and used the concept of Box model for proper alignment.

If you're a beginner you might just want to know about box shadow , see the code below:

```css
box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
```

You may use other type of css selector which is nth-child() , It helps you keeping your code neat (Using class selectors messes up the code)

```css
.content img:nth-child(1) {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```
